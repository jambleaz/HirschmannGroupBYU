Here is a list of goals that we each hope to accomplish in the near-future.

Nate:
* Eccentricity Reduction - figure out things
* Iron out bugs and details in the CFD Coefficients Notebook
* Clean up code in the CFD Notebook
* Work on doing runs of EM Code with Andrew

James:
* Reproducing Kim's filters
* Generalizing Kim's (interior) filters for any order scheme
* Understand Kim's boundary schemes (filtered and non-filtered)
* Work on EM Code runs
* Add eigenvalue testing into the "operator pipeline"

Luke:
* Working code to analyze convergence of different schemes
* Finish 1D Wave and 1D Advection for 1st and 2nd derivatives
* Compare different boundary conditions and resolutions
* Make the code more user-friendly


Helping each other out:
* For Nate, he will share William's code and see if anyone knows what's going on.
* For Luke, he knows what he's doing.
* For James, he wants help looking at his code and implementing the filter solvers in the CFD code. Potentially needs an example parameter file from Andrew to know what structure to generate filters.
