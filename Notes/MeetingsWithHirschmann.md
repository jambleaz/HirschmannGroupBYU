# Meetings with Dr.Hirschmann

## 4/30/2024
Today we started working on learning from numex.jl. Take 1D wave equation and modify it to learn how the solve works. Then move on to bigger crazier things.

Items worked on today:
 * numex.jl - 1D Wave equation
 * Github repository created for students that work with Dr.Hirschmann
