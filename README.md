# HirschmannGroupBYU
Notes, papers, and code to be shared between Physics students working in Dr. Hirschmann's research group at BYU.


## To-do Items:
 1. Add verbose matrix output in the CFD Coefficient Solver (to match with the Mehra paper)
 2. Finish the stability analysis of the CDoubleDot matrix
 3. Resolve the discrepancy in calculating the eigenvalues of the matrix with periodic boundary conditions numerically in Mathematica vs. using the analytic form in Dr. Hirschmann's paper
 4. Add numerical eigenvalue tests to the CFD Coefficient Solver to rule out ``bad'' choices for free parameter optimization
 5. Finish commenting and cleaning the current CFD Coefficient Solver code
 6. Add the polynomial extrapolation technique from Kim's latest paper to the CFD Coefficient Solver
 7. Verify that all the coefficients in the CFD Coefficient Solver match known coefficients listed in reference papers
 8. Add an option to the CFD Coefficient Solver to choose a heptadiagonal LHS matrix
 9. Revisit the stability analysis of the CHat matrix
 10. Find an analytic form for the determinant of the pure heptadiagonal matrix
 11. Find an analytic form for the cofactors of the pure pentadiagonal matrix


## Ongoing Items:
 * Read papers in the Google Drive
 * Type up notes from working sessions in Git
 * Type up important results in $\LaTeX$
